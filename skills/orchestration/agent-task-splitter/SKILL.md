name: agent-task-splitter
description: Use when the user asks to split a goal across Claude, Codex, or Gemini (gemini requests are rerouted - lane deprecated); plan a multi-agent run; break work into parallel agent tasks; or decompose a large task that needs bounded context handoffs. This is the **generic** multi-agent task splitter — writes `.coord/plan.yml` (a DAG) plus per-agent task files. NOT for research-domain routing that touches `.research/`, `.paper/`, or Zotero/Obsidian/NotebookLM ingest pipelines — that domain is out of scope for this skill (this repo does not vendor a dedicated research-multi-agent skill; treat it as ordinary multi-agent work via the DAG above, or scope a new skill if the need is recurring).

# agent-task-splitter

Bridge between **a high-level goal** and **the multi-agent execution
pipeline**. You write `.coord/plan.yml` (the DAG) and the per-agent
task files. The delegate skills (`codex-delegate`; historically
`gemini-delegate`) invoke the agents using those task files. The
reconciler reads what they produce.

This skill **does not invoke any agent**. It only plans and writes
files.

> **DEPRECATION + REROUTE (2026-06-18, updated 2026-07-10): the Gemini
> lane is DEAD — it fails closed. Never emit `agent: gemini` tasks.**
> Reroute what used to go there:
>
> | Used to route to `gemini` | Route now |
> |---|---|
> | CJK / bilingual judgment, 語感, long-form writing | `claude` (inline — judgment stays with the orchestrator) |
> | Bulk mechanical CJK (mirror sync, term sweeps) | `codex` |
> | Long-context reading + synthesis | `claude` inline, or `claude-cheap` when the reading is extraction/transcription-shaped |
> | Second-opinion review of generated output | `claude` (a review is an honesty-critical task — never a cheap tier) |
> | Experimental: Antigravity CLI (`agy`) as a future lane | n=1 scoped-edit + no-commit probe PASS (2026-07-10; requires `--mode accept-edits` in print mode) — capability existence only, reliability UNMEASURED; still not a default lane |
>
> The `gemini` value remains PARSE-ONLY so reconcilers can read
> historical plans; §6b is retained as a legacy reference.

## Why use this instead of hand-rolling briefs

The supervisor (Claude) writing 2-3 brief files by hand looks cheap but
costs token + drift in two specific ways:

| Hand-rolled briefs | This skill |
|---|---|
| Same context block (file paths, conventions, in-scope list) repeated across 3 task files — 3× redundant token cost in main session. | Splitter writes once into `.coord/plan.yml`, references it from each task file. |
| Subtle drift between briefs ("Codex was told to update README, Gemini was told to mirror Stage 6" — but Codex's scope quietly included Stage 6 too). F11 incident shipped because of this. | Splitter computes the file-scope set once and propagates the disjoint partition. |
| Operator forgets which agent gets which task type (codex for mechanical, gemini for long-context CJK). | Routing rules baked in — same agent gets the same shape of work every time. |

### Measured impact (real dogfood, 2026-05-14)

| Setup | Main session tokens | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **With splitter** (R2 + R4 combined: 2 parallel Codex + 1 mirror sync Gemini) | ~9k tokens (R2 ~5k + R4 ~4k, measured) | Splitter wrote 5 KB of plan.yml + briefs; main session read only structured summaries |
| **Hand-rolled equivalent** (estimated counterfactual) | ~107-127k tokens (R2 control ~37k + R4 control ~70-90k) | Operator inlines all context per brief, parses each agent's raw stdout, reconciles by hand |
| **Saving** | **~12-14×** combined (R2 ~7× + R4 ~17-22× per round) | Plus the splitter's disjoint-scope partition prevented F11-class drift |

The skill earns its keep when ≥ 2 subtasks go to different agents (or
same agent in parallel). For 1-shot delegation, call the delegate skill
directly.

### Anti-patterns this skill prevents

- **F11** (cross-agent scope creep): Agent A sweeps a rule into files
  that were Agent B's responsibility. Prevented by `.coord/plan.yml`'s
  explicit `files_in_scope` partition per task.
- **F14** (skipping the splitter for "small enough" 2-agent runs):
  Operator decides to hand-roll because "it's only 2 tasks", and the
  drift catches them later. The CLAUDE.md template below makes the
  trigger mechanical: ≥ 2 parallel delegates → splitter is mandatory,
  no judgment call.

### CLAUDE.md snippet to enforce routing

```markdown
## Multi-agent routing rule (enforced)

If a single round needs ≥ 2 delegate agents running in parallel (e.g.,
codex + claude-cheap, or 2 codex on independent subtasks): invoke
`Skill("agent-collab-workspace:agent-task-splitter", args="round=N ...")`
FIRST. Do NOT hand-roll briefs into `.ai/codex_task_*.md` directly when
≥ 2 are needed in the same round.

Decision rule (no judgment): 1 delegate per round → call delegate
directly. ≥ 2 parallel → splitter first, then per-tool delegate.
```

## When to use

Trigger phrases:

- "Split this task across Claude / Codex / Gemini." (Gemini requests
  get rerouted per the deprecation table above.)
- "Plan a multi-agent run for `<goal>`."
- "Break this down into parallel agent tasks."
- "Decompose this goal into Codex + cheap-Claude subtasks."
- "Make a `.coord/plan.yml` for this work."

Not for:

- Running the agents themselves — that's `codex-delegate` (the
  Claude lanes run via the Agent tool; `gemini-delegate` is
  deprecated).
- Reconciling agent outputs after they run — that's
  `agent-output-reconciler`.
- Single-agent tasks — if the whole job is one Codex run, just use
  `codex-delegate` directly. This skill earns its keep when there
  are ≥ 2 subtasks plausibly going to different agents.

## Inputs

The user provides one or both of:

1. **The goal**: a sentence or paragraph describing what they want.
2. **Constraints** (optional): which agents are available, time
   budget, files in / out of scope, success criteria they already
   know.

You may also read existing project context if relevant:

- `.coord/memory.yml` — prior decisions / open questions (if
  `agent-shared-memory` has run before).
- `.research/project_manifest.yml` — research project context (if
  `research-context-compressor` from `ai-research-skills` has run).

If the goal is large, cross-session, or likely to involve parallel
multi-delegate work, use `agent-context-budget` before writing task
files. It sets the bounded handoff policy that prevents context
overflow.

## Workflow

### 0. Verify cwd is the project root before writing anything

`.coord/plan.yml`, `.ai/<agent>_task_*.md`, and all downstream
artifacts go to **the project the agents will modify**, not whatever
directory Claude currently happens to be in. Before writing
anything, confirm:

1. The cwd matches the repo the user actually means.
2. If the user is in a worktree (`.git` is a file pointing to
   a worktree dir, not a real `.git/` directory), confirm they want
   `.coord/` in the worktree or the main checkout — these can differ.
3. If working across multiple repos in one conversation, ask which
   one the multi-agent run targets.

This step takes 5 seconds and prevents writing `.coord/plan.yml`
to the wrong filesystem location, which silently breaks downstream
agents that look for it relative to their own `-C`/cwd.

### 1. Understand the goal

Restate the goal back to the user in 1-2 sentences before planning.
If anything is ambiguous (which files, which tests count as
success), ask **one focused clarifying question** before producing
the plan. Don't ask 5 questions; ask the single question that most
narrows the design space.

### 2. Decompose into subtasks

Break the goal into 2-7 subtasks. For each subtask, decide:

| Property | How to determine |
|---|---|
| `id` | `T1`, `T2`, ... contiguous |
| `agent` | One of `codex` / `claude` / `claude-cheap` (see classification below; `gemini` is PARSE-ONLY legacy — never emit it) |
| `model` | Optional, `claude-cheap` only: the cheap tier to pin (default `haiku`) |
| `slug` | kebab-case task identifier (≤ 30 chars) |
| `description` | one line |
| `depends_on` | list of `T_n` ids that must complete first; `[]` if none |
| `files_in_scope` | glob list of files this task may modify |
| `files_out_of_scope` | glob list this task must NOT touch |
| `success_criteria` | 1-3 bullets, each a runnable check (`pytest`, `ls`, `grep`) or a checkable assertion |

**Guidance on subtask granularity:** if a subtask exceeds ~50 lines
of expected diff or requires more than one round of tool calls, it's
too big — split further. If a subtask is < 10 lines of expected
work, fold it into a sibling.

### 3. Classify each subtask: Codex vs cheap-Claude vs Claude

Use this routing table. When in doubt, see
`references/task_splitter_heuristics.md` for nuanced cases.
**Classification stays with the strong orchestrator — never let a
cheap lane reclassify itself** (measured basis: the cost-router
benchmark in `fable-method-harness/benchmarks/route_cost_ab/` —
routed = all-strong on quality and stability at ~0.4x cost, and the
cheap tier misses subtle-honesty tasks deterministically, 0/5).

| Route to | Best for | Avoid |
|---|---|---|
| `codex` | Multi-file mechanical implementation, batch refactors, test scaffolds, regex-able edits across N files, boilerplate generation, codegen from clear specs | Architecture decisions, debugging root cause, security review, ambiguous requirements |
| `claude-cheap` (Haiku-class subagent) | Single-shot mechanical work that needs no repo-wide edit rights: transcribe, sort, reformat, extract, count, schema-fill, apply-a-stated-pattern on bounded input | ANY honesty-critical output: "all green" verdicts, spec-discrepancy checks, reviews, completion claims (measured 0/5 on subtle honesty); ambiguous specs |
| `claude` | API contract design, bug diagnosis, acceptance review, design judgment, anything needing project memory / cross-conversation context; ALL honesty-critical verdicts | Token-heavy mechanical work better suited to `codex`/`claude-cheap` |
| `gemini` | **DEPRECATED — never emit.** See the reroute table at the top | — |

A useful sanity check: **if the subtask is "do X to many files in
roughly the same way", that's Codex. If it is "do this one bounded
mechanical thing and return the result", that's claude-cheap. If
the subtask is "decide whether X is right", that's Claude — always.**

### 4. Identify dependencies (DAG)

For each subtask, list which other subtasks must finish before it
can start (`depends_on`). Common patterns:

- **Linear chain**: `T1 → T2 → T3` (each depends on previous).
- **Fan-out**: `T1 → [T2, T3, T4]` (T2/3/4 parallel after T1).
- **Fan-in**: `[T2, T3] → T4` (T4 needs both).
- **Independent**: all `depends_on: []` — runnable fully parallel.

Avoid cycles. If you have one, redesign.

### 5. Write `.coord/plan.yml`

Schema (full reference: `references/task_splitter_heuristics.md`):

```yaml
round: 1
goal: "Refactor the auth module into plugin-based architecture"
budget:
  tokens: 200000          # optional, gate skill checks against this
  duration_min: 60        # optional advisory
context_policy:
  main_session_token_budget: 3000
  task_packet_token_budget: 6000
  result_summary_word_budget: 250
  memory_digest_token_budget: 1200
  log_tail_lines_on_error: 50
  raw_log_policy: path-only
  agentmemory: optional
created_utc: "2026-04-28T09:00:00Z"
tasks:
  - id: T1
    agent: codex
    slug: extract-interfaces
    description: "Define abstract base classes in src/auth/interfaces.py"
    depends_on: []
    files_in_scope:
      - "src/auth/interfaces.py"
    files_out_of_scope:
      - "src/auth/legacy.py"
      - "tests/**"
    success_criteria:
      - "src/auth/interfaces.py exists and defines AuthProvider ABC"
      - "no other source files modified"
  - id: T2
    agent: codex
    slug: refactor-providers
    description: "Move existing provider classes to inherit from new ABC"
    depends_on: [T1]
    files_in_scope:
      - "src/auth/providers/*.py"
    success_criteria:
      - "pytest tests/auth/test_providers.py passes"
      - "no imports of src.auth.legacy from other modules"
  - id: T3
    agent: claude-cheap
    model: haiku
    slug: doc-coverage-inventory
    description: "List every public symbol in src/auth and whether it has a docstring mentioning the legacy class (mechanical inventory; the JUDGMENT of coverage adequacy stays in T4)"
    depends_on: [T1, T2]
    success_criteria:
      - "a table of every public symbol in src/auth with has_docstring yes/no"
      - "rows flagged where the docstring mentions the legacy class"
  - id: T4
    agent: claude
    slug: design-review
    description: "Read T1-T3 outputs, verify the architecture choice survives the implementation"
    depends_on: [T1, T2, T3]
    success_criteria:
      - "explicit YES/NO verdict + rationale in chat"
```

### 6. Write per-agent task files

Each lane has **its own task file convention**. Don't use a single
template for all — each executor expects its own shape.

**Every task brief MUST include a pre-task scope confirmation block
(W1, prevents drift)**:

```markdown
## Pre-task scope confirmation (REQUIRED — your first action)

Before any file edit, echo back the scope you understand:

  Confirmed scope: will touch
    - <file1>
    - <file2>
  Will NOT touch
    - <file3>
    - any file not listed under "Files in scope" above
    - any meta-documentation table (F11)
    - any unrequested metadata line (F12)

If your understanding doesn't match the brief's "Files in scope"
section, STOP and ask for clarification before editing anything.
```

This block is verified post-task by `agent-acceptance-gate` §6.6
(scope diff check via `git diff --name-only`).

#### 6a. Codex task files (`agent: codex`)

Path: `.ai/codex_task_<NNN>_<slug>.md`. `<NNN>` is the zero-padded
`round` (`001` for round 1). Format follows `codex-delegate`'s
"Supervisor Workflow" section:

```markdown
# Task: <description>

## Context
- Repo: <absolute path>
- Plan: .coord/plan.yml (round <N>, task <T-id>)
- Read these files first:
  - <files_in_scope items + relevant references>
- Only modify (files_in_scope):
  - <files_in_scope items>
  - .ai/codex_result_<NNN>_<slug>.md   ← REQUIRED: the result-summary file
- Do NOT touch (files_out_of_scope):
  - <files_out_of_scope items>
- Depends on outputs of: <list T-ids + their result paths>

## Goal
<task.description, expanded with concrete deliverable>

## Constraints
- Follow adjacent code style.
- Do not make architectural changes beyond the scope.
- Do not edit files outside the allowed list.

## Acceptance
- Required tests: <test command from success_criteria>
- Required result summary: write a concise summary to
  .ai/codex_result_<NNN>_<slug>.md
- Summary limit: <= 250 words. Include changed files, tests run,
  risks, and blockers. Do not paste raw logs.
```

> **Critical**: `.ai/codex_result_<NNN>_<slug>.md` MUST appear in
> `files_in_scope`. The Acceptance section requires writing there;
> if it's not in scope, codex flags a self-conflict and may refuse
> to write it.

> **Critical (Codex invocation)**: when launching codex directly
> (not via the `codex-delegate` wrapper script), **close stdin
> with `< /dev/null`** — codex-cli ≥ 0.121.0 otherwise hangs at

>   "Read .ai/codex_task_<NNN>_<slug>.md and execute all instructions inside." \
>   < /dev/null
>
> # Fallback (only if you need raw stdout for diagnostics): MUST cap with head
> # WITHOUT this cap, codex retries + verbose tool calls can grow logs to

>
> The `codex-delegate` wrapper script (`run_codex.sh`) handles both
> the `-o` flag and the 10 MB log cap internally; only direct

#### 6b. Gemini task files (`agent: gemini`) — LEGACY, DO NOT EMIT

> **The Gemini lane is deprecated (fails closed). This section is
> retained ONLY so reconcilers can interpret historical runs'
> `.ai/gemini_*` files. Never write a new gemini task file; never
> dispatch to gemini-cli. Route per the deprecation table at the top.**

Path: `.ai/gemini_task_<NNN>_<slug>.md`. Format follows
`gemini-delegate`'s "Supervisor Workflow" — different sections from
codex:

```markdown
# Task: <description>

## Context
- Repo: <absolute path>
- Plan: .coord/plan.yml (round <N>, task <T-id>)
- Read these files first:
  - <files_in_scope items + relevant references>
- Output file(s):
  - <files this task produces>
  - .ai/gemini_result_<NNN>_<slug>.md   ← REQUIRED: the result-summary file
- Depends on outputs of: <list T-ids + their result paths>

## Goal
<task.description, expanded with concrete deliverable>

## Language
- Output language: <English | Traditional Chinese | Simplified Chinese | bilingual>
- Tone: <formal | concise | technical | executive>
- Audience: <who will read it>

## Constraints
- Preserve dates, proper nouns, code identifiers exactly.
- Keep terminology consistent with referenced sources.
- Do not invent facts missing from the inputs.

## Acceptance
- Required verification files: <files Claude will check after run>
- Required sentinel strings: <strings the gate will grep for>
- Required result summary: write a concise summary to
  .ai/gemini_result_<NNN>_<slug>.md
- Summary limit: <= 250 words. Include findings, files inspected,
  risks, and blockers. Do not paste raw logs.
- Self-review checklist (REQUIRED, see docs/observed-failure-modes.md F9):
  Before declaring done, agent must explicitly verify:
  1. Slugs in output files match `plan.yml` slug VERBATIM (F7)
  2. Table column counts are unchanged for any table the task touched (F2)
  3. No time-relative phrases ("today", "this week", "soon") in output (F3)
- Claude will perform a final review (terminology, factual accuracy,
  schema adherence) before merging.

## Banned phrasing (output-language-agnostic, applies in all locales)
- Time-relative: "today", "this week", "yesterday", "soon",
  "recently", "now" — replace with absolute year or "actively
  maintained" / specific date.
- Vague popularity: "popular", "widely used" — replace with star
  count + date or specific user count.
- Unverified status: "production-ready", "battle-tested" — only if
  primary source confirms.
```

> **Critical (Gemini-specific, F1 in `docs/observed-failure-modes.md`)**:
> gemini-cli **refuses to read gitignored files by default**. Since
> `.ai/` is conventionally gitignored to keep transient task files
> out of commits, this means
> `gemini -p "Read .ai/gemini_task_<NNN>_<slug>.md and execute"`
> **WILL FAIL** with `"File path '.ai/...' is ignored by configured
> ignore patterns."` — this is the single most common Gemini failure
> mode observed in dogfooding.
>
> **(Legacy invocation notes removed 2026-07-10.)** The historical
> `cat .ai/gemini_task_* | gemini --yolo -p ...` pipe and the
> `.ai/gemini_run_*.sh` sidecar convention are documented in this
> repo's git history (pre-`0.2.0`) if a historical run ever needs
> re-interpretation. Do NOT reconstruct or run them — the lane fails
> closed.

#### 6c. Claude tasks (`agent: claude`)

**Don't write a task file.** Claude executes inline in the current
conversation. The plan.yml entry serves as the spec.

#### 6c-2. Cheap-Claude tasks (`agent: claude-cheap`)

Path: `.ai/claude_task_<NNN>_<slug>.md` — same brief shape as codex
task files (scope confirmation block, acceptance, result file
`.ai/claude_result_<NNN>_<slug>.md`), because the executor is a
context-blind subagent, not the orchestrating session.

Invocation (Claude Code): spawn a subagent with the model pinned to
the cheap tier —

```
Agent(prompt="Read .ai/claude_task_<NNN>_<slug>.md and execute it
      verbatim; write the result summary to the path it names.",
      model="haiku")
```

Guardrails (never optional; measured basis:
`fable-method-harness/core/model_routing_playbook.md`):

- The ORCHESTRATOR classifies; a cheap lane never reclassifies or
  extends its own scope — uncertainty escalates to `claude`.
- No honesty-critical output on this lane — no "all green" verdicts,
  no spec-discrepancy calls, no reviews, no completion claims
  (cheap tier measured 0/5 replicate trials on the subtle-honesty task).
- Every cheap-lane return is re-verified by the orchestrator before
  merging ("delegate returned" is itself a review trigger).

### 6d. Task-shape guidance (prevents F6 over-tabularization)

Before writing the task body, classify the task by **output shape**:

| Task shape | Format guidance to include in brief |
|---|---|
| **Pedagogical** (curriculum, tutorial, explainer) | "Prefer prose. A table is justified ONLY if (a) data is genuinely comparative (≥3 attributes per row) AND (b) reader will use it as decision tool, not inventory. 'Catalog of N variants' is anti-pattern — replace with prose covering 2-3 axes + `<details>` for long tail." |
| **Reference** (API docs, schema definitions) | "Tables OK for structured data. Each table should answer one specific question." |
| **Catalog** (project listings, comparisons) | "Tables OK but include: (a) ≤ 10 entries in primary table; (b) `<details>` collapsible for long tail; (c) live `gh api` verification step for stars/license/pushed_at — required in `result.md`." |
| **Migration / mechanical edit** (rename, replace pattern) | "No tables. Concrete file list + diff summary." |
| **Translation / mirror-sync** | "Maintain source structure VERBATIM. No new tables, no removed tables, no merged tables. Column counts must match per-table across locales. (F2 incident)" |

This block should appear in `## Format guidance` section of every
task brief. Skipping it is the F6 root cause.

**Also include these 2 explicit prohibitions in every brief that
applies a sweep rule across files (prevents F11, F12)**:

```markdown
## Drift guards — DO NOT (F11, F12 from docs/observed-failure-modes.md)

### F11. Skip meta-documentation tables

Do NOT replace term X with term Y in any row that literally documents
the X→Y mapping. This applies to:
- `resources/style-guide.md` contrast tables (zh-TW ↔ zh-Hans conversion)
- Glossary entries where the term being swept IS the entry title
- Any "convention reference" table

The literal term must remain to document the rule itself.

### F12. No metadata injection

Do NOT add any of these lines unless the brief explicitly requests:
- `Attributions: <names>` / `Attribution: <name>` / `Credits: ...`
- `Source: <link>` / `Citation: <ref>` / `References: ...`
- Any meta-line about the document's authorship / sourcing

Glosses are INLINE explanations of jargon, NOT source attributions.
If attribution is needed, the brief will say so explicitly.
```

### 6e. Fact-verification step (prevents F4, F5)

For any task that asserts external facts (star counts, model
releases, license types, benchmark numbers, paper acceptance
status), the task brief MUST include:

```markdown
## Fact verification (REQUIRED)

Before writing any "★ Nk", "License: X", or "(Year) Model" claim,
run the live check:

  # For GitHub repos:
  gh api repos/<org>/<repo> --jq '{stars: .stargazers_count,
    license: .license.spdx_id, pushed: .pushed_at, archived: .archived}'

  # For arxiv papers:
  curl -s "https://arxiv.org/abs/<id>" | grep -o "title>[^<]*"

Quote the actual returned value in `result.md`. Any claim NOT
verified this way must be marked `(claimed, unverified)` so the
reconciler / acceptance gate can flag it.
```

This step prevented the DeepSeek-R2 fabrication incident (F4) when
applied retroactively.

### 7. Hand off to the user

End with:

```
Plan written to .coord/plan.yml (round 1, N tasks).
Task files ready:
  .ai/codex_task_001_<slug1>.md
  .ai/codex_task_001_<slug2>.md
  .ai/claude_task_001_<slug3>.md

Next steps:
  # Run codex tasks (after T1 finishes, T2/T3 can run in parallel).
  # Option A (preferred) — use the codex-delegate wrapper:
  bash .claude/skills/codex-delegate/scripts/run_codex.sh \
    --prompt "Read .ai/codex_task_001_<slug1>.md and execute all instructions inside." \
    --log-file .ai/codex_log_001_<slug1>.txt

  # Option B — direct codex exec with -o for structured result (preferred over raw stdout):
  codex exec --sandbox workspace-write -m gpt-5.5 \
    -o .ai/codex_result_001_<slug1>.jsonl \
    "Read .ai/codex_task_001_<slug1>.md and execute all instructions inside." \
    < /dev/null
  # If you must capture stdout (diagnostics only), CAP it (prevents the
  # 7 GB runaway-log incident — see step 6a):
  #   ... 2>&1 | head -c 10485760 > .ai/codex_log_001_<slug1>.txt

  # Run cheap-Claude tasks as pinned-model subagents (Claude Code):
  #   Agent(prompt="Read .ai/claude_task_001_<slug3>.md and execute it
  #         verbatim; write the result summary to the path it names.",
  #         model="haiku")

  # After all delegate tasks finish, reconcile:
  # invoke agent-output-reconciler in this session
```

### 8. Re-plan workflow (when reassigning agents mid-round)

If the user reassigns a task to a different agent **after** plan.yml
and task files were already written (e.g., "actually, T2 should be
claude-cheap, not codex"):

1. **Edit the agent assignment in `.coord/plan.yml`** for that
   single task. Don't bulk-replace — surgical edit only. Bulk
   `sed` replacements typically over-match and rewrite assignments
   you wanted to keep.

2. **Delete the obsolete task file** (e.g., the old
   `.ai/codex_task_<NNN>_<slug>.md` if T2 was codex and is now
   claude-cheap). Lingering obsolete files confuse the reconciler — it
   may pick them up and report on a task that didn't actually run.

3. **Write the new task file** in the new agent's format (per step
   6a / 6c-2). Slug stays the same; only the agent prefix changes.

4. **If dependents already ran** (e.g., T3 ran depending on T2's
   old codex output): note in the round's `.coord/memory.yml`
   that T3's output was based on a now-stale T2; flag for re-review
   in the reconciliation report.

Re-planning mid-round is normal. The schema supports it; just be
explicit about what changed instead of letting orphan files
accumulate.

## What NOT to do

- **Don't run any agent.** This skill stops at writing files.
- **Don't fabricate `success_criteria`.** If the user hasn't told
  you what success looks like and you can't infer it from context,
  ask before writing the plan.
- **Don't create unbounded task packets.** Use `context_policy` and
  keep each task file to the critical files, constraints, and result
  contract. Link paths instead of pasting logs or long analysis.
- **Don't classify everything as Codex.** Real multi-agent runs
  benefit from heterogeneity. If your plan has 5 tasks all routed
  to Codex, reconsider whether the goal needs a multi-agent split
  or just one big Codex run.
- **Don't put architecture / design decisions in `agent: codex`
  tasks.** Those go to Claude (or to `agent-debate` if
  consequential).
- **Don't number `<NNN>` independently per task.** It matches
  `round`. All tasks in round 1 use `001` in their filename. The
  task `slug` distinguishes them.

## Heuristics for the hardest case (when to split at all)

If you find yourself writing a 1-task plan, you're using the wrong
skill — invoke `codex-delegate` or `claude` directly. The splitter
earns its keep when:

- The goal has both judgment-heavy and mechanical components.
- Multiple files / domains / stages need work in parallel.
- A long-context read + a code edit are both required.
- An adversarial review on the result would be valuable (then
  consider also queueing `agent-debate` after).

## Subagent review (keep main session lean)

**When**: ≥ 4 task files written in one round, OR ≥ 2 agents will run
in parallel.

**Why**: The main session that just wrote `plan.yml` + N task files
already holds the entire plan in context. Asking it to also verify
slug/agent/path consistency across all task files doubles the context
cost. Delegate the verification to a subagent that returns only the
verdict.

**Pattern** (Claude Code's Task tool, or equivalent subagent harness):

```
Spawn `code-reviewer` subagent with this brief:
- Read .coord/plan.yml + every .ai/{codex,claude}_task_<NNN>_*.md
  generated this round (the gemini glob applies only when reconciling
  a historical pre-deprecation round)
- Verify: (a) each plan.yml task has a matching task file at correct
  path; (b) slugs in filenames match plan.yml task.slug exactly;
  (c) agent assignment matches; (d) no orphan task files from prior
  rounds; (e) each task file's "Output file(s)" section references
  the required result-summary path
- Return: PASS / FAIL + ≤ 200-word verdict + list of any drifted
  slug/agent/path mismatches

Main session reads only the verdict; never re-reads the task files.
```

If subagent reports FAIL, run step 8 (re-plan) on the flagged tasks
before invoking delegates.

## Output to user (final message format)

```
[agent-task-splitter]
  Plan: .coord/plan.yml (round 1, 4 tasks)
  Routing: 2× codex, 1× claude-cheap, 1× claude
  DAG: T1 → [T2, T3] → T4
  Task files ready under .ai/

  Run order (respecting dependencies):
    1. codex T1 (no deps)
    2. codex T2 + claude-cheap T3 (parallel after T1)
    3. claude T4 (after T2 + T3)

  After all 3 external tasks finish:
    invoke agent-output-reconciler
```


## Commit Boundary

Every agent boundary is a commit boundary (see global rule:
~/.claude/CLAUDE.md → "Commit Discipline for Multi-Agent Work"). This
makes multi-agent work auditable (commit log = agent log) and enables
surgical rollback via `git revert <hash>` of just one agent's commit.

**Specific to this skill**: after the splitter writes `.coord/plan.yml` and per-agent `.ai/<agent>_task_<NNN>_<slug>.md` files, commit them as a single 'plan commit' before any agent begins execution. This gives every downstream agent's commit a clean parent to attribute work against.
